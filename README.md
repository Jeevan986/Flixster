# Flix

Flix is an app that allows users to browse movies from the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

When users download your app, it will earn a coveted place on their home screen. When a user taps your app's home screen icon, they'll briefly see a launch screen while your app loads. In this user story you'll configure your app icon and style the launch screen.
